    <h1>HOW IS WAS INSPIRED TO BECOME A DEVELOPER </h1>
    <p>Because I learned at a very early age, far before I ever could have even been exposed to computers or coding, <br> that approaching humans and the problems you can have with them leads to very different outcomes, even if the situation and <br> the approach are identical. What you say to one person might calm them down if they’re angry, for example, while saying the exact same thing to another person in an identical situation might totally enrage them. With people, there’s just no way to tell what kind of results you’re going to get.

    sty, <br> I guess primarily because it was fun.
        
        t output based on your input virtually every time. <br> Even if it’s not the outcome you want, because the computer is doing what you TOLD it to do instead of what you really WANTED <br> it to do, it’s consistentntirely depend on</p>
